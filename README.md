## Abstract
The advances in the field of image deblurring can
be attributed to the adoption of $l_p$, ($p$ = 1,2) as loss functions in
Deep Neural Network (DNN) based architectures. These losses,
albeit simple, do not capture the perceptual quality markers of
an image, such as sharpness. In this work, we propose a novel
method of utilizing a no-reference sharpness metric $Q$ introduced
by Zhu and Milanfar for removing out-of-focus blur. We also
introduce a dataset comprising of real-world out-of-focus images
for assessing and benchmarking restoration models. Our method
shows a 7.5% increase in the perceptual quality as compared to
a standard model trained on the $l_p$ norm as a loss
